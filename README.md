# Saper game #

## 1. Requirements ##

Game does not require any additional libraries.
The only requirement is **Python 3**.
Tested on Python 3.8.5, but should be compatible with other Python 3 versions.


## 2. Usage ##

Starting a game:
```shell
python3 saper.py
```
Game will ask itself for user guess and proceed the input.
> Note: _game works fully in terminal and uses colorful output_


## 3. Service menu ##

Below are listed currently implemented commands

command   | action
----------|--------
`show`    | shows all fields
`hide`    | hides fields uncovered with `show` command

To use a command, just type it in as your guess.
> Note: _commands do not count as a move_
